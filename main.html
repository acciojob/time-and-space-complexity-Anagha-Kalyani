	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to the measure of the amount of time required for an algorithm to process its input data. It's a crucial aspect in analyzing algorithm efficiency. By understanding the time complexity of an algorithm, we can gauge how its performance scales with input size. A more efficient algorithm typically exhibits lower time complexity, meaning it can handle larger inputs in less time compared to less efficient algorithms.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b>, often denoted as O(n), refers to the amount of memory required by an algorithm to execute as a function of the input size. It quantifies how much additional memory the algorithm needs to store temporary variables, data structures, and other components during its execution. Understanding space complexity is crucial for assessing an algorithm's memory usage and scalability. Algorithms with lower space complexity are considered more efficient as they require less memory to process larger inputs.</p>
